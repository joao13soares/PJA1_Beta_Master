Perpetua Insanus game made in Unity, as a project for the Project I university course.

The goal of this project was to develop a full Unity game.
We decided to implement a Survival Horror game where you play as John Lambert. You are trapped in a mental asylum and must explore and use everything that you can find, in order to escape and survive.

This was a university group project made by:
- João Soares https://github.com/joao13soares
- Luís Silva https://github.com/oceanncs
- Paulo Macedo https://github.com/Pauloamm
- Fábio Silva https://github.com/fabiodanil2
